# FinOps Cost Extraction – Python

This repository contains a simple Python-based approach to extract
cloud cost data and prepare it for FinOps analysis and reporting.

## Why this exists
In many organizations, cloud cost data is available but not easily usable.
This project focuses on:
- predictable data extraction
- minimal dependencies
- formats that work well with analytics tools

## What this covers
- Cost data extraction using cloud billing APIs
- Basic normalization of cost fields
- Output suitable for reporting or further processing

## Typical use cases
- Power BI dashboards
- Monthly cost reviews
- Cost anomaly investigations
- Input for automation or governance workflows

## Notes
This is a reference implementation.
Authentication, scopes, and scheduling should be adapted based on
organizational security and governance requirements.
